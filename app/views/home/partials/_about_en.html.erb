&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm young, perspective Ruby on Rails developer. I love traveling,
fond of hiking and outdoor activities. I have interests in history, sociology, economics, oratory arts,
engineering and microcontroller systems.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have small blog. It helps me to decrease time for standard operations and increase amount of
Ruby on Rails documentation (I hope it will increase rails popularity).
